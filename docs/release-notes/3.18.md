Installing and upgrading
------------------------

The canonical source of installation documentation is

[http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/](http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/)

Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both [manual](/install/upgrade/#manual-upgrade) and [automatic](/install/upgrade/#upgrades-with-upgradesh-script) upgrade processes.

It is still imperative that you read the upgrade path and version-specific information and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.

Changes
-------

### Major notables

* Deployment strategies
    * It's now possible to create a Git-based platform by default, without having to enable extra modules.
    * It's now possible to create a Composer-based platform by default, without having to install and enable extra modules.
* Subdirectory site improvements (e.g. `example.com/site1`)
    * These now work properly with Nginx.  Previously, only Apache was supported.
    * The UX is much improved: No more fiddling with aliases; You can now enter `example.com/site1` directly as the site name.

Known Issues
------------
* The install test on Debian oldstable (jessie) kept failing, ignored for now.
* If you separately installed the [aegir_rules](https://www.drupal.org/project/aegir_rules) integration module, be sure you have atleast the 3.0 version. Earlier beta's will cause an upgrade error.
* When the MYSQL password policy was set to MEDIUM creating databases can fail, see [issue 2868803](https://www.drupal.org/project/hostmaster/issues/2868803) for more info.
* When upgrading from Aegir 2.x be aware of [these notes](../install/upgrade/#major-upgrade-from-aegir-6x-2x).
