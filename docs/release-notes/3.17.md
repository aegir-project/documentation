Installing and upgrading
------------------------

The canonical source of installation documentation is

[http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/](http://docs.aegirproject.org/en/3.x/install/)

Within those sections you'll find step-by-step instructions for performing both [manual](/install/upgrade/#manual-upgrade) and [automatic](/install/upgrade/#upgrades-with-upgradesh-script) upgrade processes.

It is still imperative that you read the upgrade path and version-specific information and follow all version-specific upgrade instructions before trying to run the upgrade script or manual upgrade.

* When the MYSQL password policy was set to MEDIUM creating databases can fail, see [issue 2868803](https://www.drupal.org/project/hostmaster/issues/2868803) for more info.
* When upgrading from Aegir 2.x be aware of [these notes](../install/upgrade/#major-upgrade-from-aegir-6x-2x).
